# Telegram Ideas Collector

There was a time when I was using Telegram as my main working layer for everything. Every note, idea, though, task was jot down in the chat with myself.

I coded this Telegram bot that is connected with Trello to automate the "things" collection. It has several commands, and can understand the difference between ideas, links, tasks, notes.

You can see this as a MyMind.com a couple of years before.
